            <p>My life is not entirely exciting, but there are several things that I like to share about myself:</p>

     <h1 id="cats">&Gg; Cats</h1>

   <p>I've had many cats throughout my life, and they've always been a joy to live with. They're quirky, independent, 
       loving and cuddly. The ones I've loved the most were the ones that I've owned as an adult and thus had to scoop their poop myself...</p>
       <h2>Chunky</h2>
       <p>My spirit animal. He's starting to get up there in years, and he will leave a hole in my heart when he crosses the rainbow bridge. 
           He is my constant companion, but he's also a dirty thief. He stole a bag of Funyuns &dagger; from me once and ate half the bag before I could
           wrangle it back from him. 
       </p>     
       <h2>Nougat</h2>
       <p>Chunky and Nougat were the first cats I owned out of college. While we only had Nougat a short while, he was the most
           mellow cat I've ever had, and very loving. He had lots of fun weird quirks like getting trapped in paper grocery bags and climbing
           on top of the fridge to take a nap.
       </p>
       <h2>Snickers</h2>
       <p>
           By far one of the "cat"-iest cats I've had. She's extremely weird (can only pick her up a certain way, don't touch her paws, etc), 
           and slinks around the house. She's also probably one of the fattest cats I've had. She's probably as heavy as my youngest son. She 
           will nap in the bathtub (no water), eat plastic bags, and chew through all of my electronics cords. She's pretty funny when I give
            her some catnip though.
