       <h4>Fun Facts</h4>
            <li>
            Cats can jump 5 times their height
            </li>
            <li>
             Adult cats have 30 teeth, while kittens have 26.
             </li>
             <li>
            A house cat is genetically 95.6% tiger.
            </li>
            <li>
             Cats can run around 48 kph (30 mph), but only over short distances.
            </li>
            <li>
            Yes, cats will push something off the counter while staring you straight in the face, for no reason.
            </li>
     <p>
       I've had many cats throughout my life, and they've always been a joy to live with. They're quirky, independent, 
       loving and cuddly. The cats I've loved the most were the ones that I've owned as an adult and thus had to scoop their poop 
       myself...

       <h3>Chunky</h3>
       <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/pyuikyrswk4ywch/chunky1.jpg?raw=1" width="700" height="400">
       <p>
           My spirit animal. Chunky was hit by a car before we adopted him, so he's always been blind in his right eye and his jaw got 
           busted up, but that's never stopped him from doing anything he's wanted to do. He's starting to get up there in years, and 
           he will leave a hole in my heart when he crosses the rainbow bridge. He is my constant companion, but he's also a dirty 
           thief. He stole a bag of Funyuns from me once and ate half the bag before I could wrangle it back from him. He acts like 
           he's elderly as he hobbles across the floor, but he suddenly has lightning speed and agility when you have a cup of milk. 
           He cuddles all day long with only me. If I'm not sitting down, he'll go lay on someone's bed. When I do 
           finally sit down after chores, he will magically turn the corner, knowing it is time to binge some Netflix.
       </p>     
       <h3>Snickers</h3>
       <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9lyrcapxg4asdxl/Snapchat-690198.jpg?raw=1" width="300" height="600">
       <p>
           By far one of the "cat"-iest cats I've had. She's extremely weird (can only pick her up a certain way, don't touch her paws, etc), 
           and slinks around the house. She's also probably one of the fattest cats I've had. She's probably as heavy as my youngest son. She 
           will nap in the bathtub (no water), eat plastic bags, and chew through all of my electronics cords. She's pretty funny when I give
            her some catnip though.
       </p>
       <h3>Munchie</h3>
       <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0jvyqo5m7l4rlbj/IMG_1260.jpg?raw=1" width="600" height="400">
       <p>
           The hunter of the house, Munchie stays alert and keeps the house safe from mice, flies, ladybugs, and other bugs. Anything larger 
           than a cat and he becomes a ghost and disappears. He is particularly cowardly when a serviceperson comes to fix something in the home. 
           He has extreme stranger danger. When he's not hiding from the boogeyman, he's very playful and sweet, always appearing in your lap 
           when you have a blanket. His tail shakes when he's happy to see you. 13/10, very good boi.

    <h4>Fun Facts - Things I Didn't Realize Until I Became A Parent</h4>
        <li>
          You have to clip their fingernails and toenails. They obviously aren't capable of fine motor skills until much later.
        </li>
        <li>
          When they are stream of consciousness talking, they are not necessarily talking to you.
        </li>
        <li>
           You didn't imagine you'd be bribing a small human to pee in a plastic pot for an M&M for 3 months straight.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your house will never be clean again. HGTV is lying to you.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will be Googling snot colors and throat colors, advice on how to help them sleep, basically Googling everything. 
            You will Google how your parents raised children without Google.

        <h3>Lucas, 4</h3>
        <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/j6sq3eecx9mu9cv/lucas_halloween_2020.PNG?raw=1" width="600" height="450">
    <p>
        My eldest son, Lucas, turned 4 last September. He's his father's clone so they butt heads more often than not. The pandemic 
        made it hard on him because we had always spent summers at the parks playing, at Target watching the commercials on the TVs, 
        walking through the malls, and going to library to rent books. Last year, we couldn't do any of them. He's very smart, so he was 
        always asking why X was closed, when it would open. I'm glad that at least we were able to find a preschool that stayed open and 
        he was able to complete Y3 Pre-K as normally as possible. He's bossy, always "managing" his little brother, but he's also very sweet 
        and funny.
        <p>Lucas, as we are touring a house with our realtor, "Mom, that old man is following us."</p>
        <p>Me, to Lucas, "Lucas, how's your root beer?" His response, "Yummy...but I know you're married."</p>
        <p>"Mommy, come on, I'm going to teach you how to pee standing up!"</p>
    </p>
    <h3>Marshall, 2</h3>
    <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/li6g7xbquzosj2x/f88cebb0-70b8-436b-97e7-d39b40ef5d81_original.JPG?raw=1" width="550" height="450">
    <p>
        Marshall turned 2 in February this year, and he is already borrowing his brother's 3T clothes. He is 3 feet tall, and a solid kid.
        He is still non-verbal. We're operating under the assumption that he may have some level of autism, and we're scheduled to get a 
        diagnosis later this year. In the meantime, we're doing different therapies: speech, occupational, and developmental. He loves 
        physical play. He runs back and forth throughout the house, and loves when I toss him into the couch cushions. He's good at signing 
        words like "more," "want," "please," "eat," "drink," etc. He's very independent and prefers to play with things his way, but he still 
        follows his brother's lead sometimes. He loves chasing bubbles, jumping on the trampoline, playing with cars, and getting into 
        trouble. He climbs anywhere he can, and he loves to pull everything out from the shelves. He's also very smart. He may not speak, but 
        I know he understands everything I'm saying. If I ask him to go get something, he'll get it. If I ask him to pick a snack, he'll grab 
        something. If I tell him to get in time out, he will begrudgingly go. I can't wait to hear some of the things he has to tell me when 
        he starts talking.

    <h4>Fun Facts - Video Game Trivia</h4>
    <li>
        Mario first appeared in the video game Donkey Kong.
    </li>
    <li>
        The first successfully commercial game was Pong.
    </li>
    <li>
        The best selling video game console was the Playstation 2.
    </li>
    <li>
        It took 10 years for Square Enix to release FF15 after it was first announced.
    </li>
    <li>
        My mom still can't figure out how to fly in Spyro.
    </li>
    <p>
        Video games was always something I enjoyed, since I was a kid. My cousin passed down her NES to me and I played Mario and Duck 
        Hunter when I was in elementary school. I remember vividly going over to my neighbor's house one day after school. He wanted to show 
        me this new video game he purchased, and we watched the opening sequence of Final Fantasy 7 together on his Playstation. It was like 
        nothing I had ever seen before, and I was captivated by the graphics and the interactive story. That year for Christmas, I received 
        my own Playstation and copy of FF7, and I've gotten every PS release since then. (Well, except this year. I'm not going to bend over 
        backwards to buy a PS5 from a scalper.) I have owned several other consoles including: Nintendo DS, Nintendo Switch, PS Vita, PSP, XBox 360, 
        and GameCube. I can't name all of the games I've played, but I can name some of my favorite games/series.
    </p>

    <h3>Mass Effect</h3>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wSA_YPbGD5s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>
        My favorite series to date. Not only is the gameplay fun, but the graphics are beautiful, the dialogues are funny, and you can explore 
        alien worlds! The idea was interesting and the cast of characters and plot pulls you in. "My name is Commander Shepard and this is my 
        favorite store on the Citadel." 
    </p>
    <h3>Dragon Age</h3>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dIJMeeI3C5w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>
        Another Bioware series. The lore is really in-depth, and I enjoyed getting to know the characters and being immersed in a rich world and story. 
        Not to mention, I get to throw fireballs, fight darkspawn, and romance my favorite broody elf. (Varric is a gem.)  
    </p>
    <h3>Final Fantasy</h3>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l_jYnCzOuBE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>
        Alright, well, any RPG list wouldn't be complete without some JRPGs thrown in. FF7 was my entrance into the Final Fantasy series, and I've 
        enjoyed most of the entries into the series. Final Fantasy 15 was a fun bro-ride. I wish the story was more thought out, but I liked the change 
        from turn based. I liked Final Fantasy 7: Remake too. It was interesting to see them revamp it. 
    </p>
    <h3>Sooo many others...</h3>
    <p>
        The Witcher series, Suikoden series (but mostly 2), Chrono Trigger/Cross, Persona, Bioshock, Borderlands, Fallout, Trails series, Marvel Ultimate Alliance, etc etc. 
        I just downloaded Yakuza: Like A Dragon, so hoping I'll enjoy the new gameplay on it.
